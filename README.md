# Rotating_IP

The program is designed to help you rotate your IP address while web scraping by utilizing a pool of free proxies. Please note that not all proxies may work, as they are provided for free and their reliability cannot be guaranteed.

The program utilizes the `requests` library in Python to send HTTP requests to the desired website. It also employs the `random` module to randomly select a proxy from the pool for each request. The process involves the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries: The program starts by importing the required libraries, including `requests` and `random`.

2. Define a list of free proxies: Create a list containing the URLs or IP addresses of the free proxies you want to use. You can find free proxy lists on various websites or use dedicated libraries for fetching proxy lists programmatically.

3. Define a function to rotate the IP address: Create a function that selects a random proxy from the list and configures the `requests` library to use that proxy for the subsequent requests. This function should handle exceptions and error cases when a proxy fails to work.

4. Implement the web scraping logic: Write the main logic of your web scraping task, which involves sending HTTP requests to the desired website using the `requests` library. Within the loop or iteration, call the function to rotate the IP address before making each request.

5. Handle exceptions: Since not all proxies may be reliable, it is essential to handle exceptions gracefully. If a request fails or encounters an error, catch the exception and retry the request with a different proxy from the pool.

6. Execute the program: Finally, run the program and observe the web scraping process. Monitor the output and handle any potential errors or exceptions that may arise.

Remember, relying solely on free proxies can be unreliable, as they may have limitations in terms of speed, uptime, or availability. For more robust and stable IP rotation, consider using paid proxy services or rotating through multiple VPN connections.
